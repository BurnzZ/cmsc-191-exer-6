The exercise was to make a web application with a basic CRUD interface for managing different types of fruits.

Each fruit has to contain details like:
    - name
    - quantity
    - distributor
    - price (this changes everyday and history of changes must be saved)


----
IMPLEMENTATION
----

A front-end boilerplate was made to have a uniform interface across all databases, as well as to speedup the coding process. A CodeIgniter PHP-framework was used in the Back-end.

Each database implementation has their own dedicated project folder, which are independent from one another.


A. MySQL

<write how implementation was done here>


B. MongoDB

<write how implementation was done here>


C. CouchDB

A database named `myfruit` was made, with each of its document representing a distinct fruit having the details mentioned above as its data items.

However, the price contains a dictionary which contains the date (represented in the format: Y-m-d) as the key, while the price for that specific date as its value.



----
Misc
----

The price changes for each day is represented by the javascript library called Highcharts.
